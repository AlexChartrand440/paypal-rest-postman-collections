Postman collections for the PayPal REST API
======

Practicing API calls before writing code is fun. And prudent.

With the files in this repo, you can use Postman to practice making calls to the PayPal REST API. They're broken down into the various resources you can access through the API, so you only import what you want.

Never used the Postman extension before? Check out this link.

By the way, this is still very much under construction. Don't expect any level of completeness for a while.
