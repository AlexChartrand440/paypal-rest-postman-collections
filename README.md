Postman collections for the PayPal REST API
======

Here are some Postman collection files so you can practice making calls to the PayPal REST API without writing any code. They're broken down into the various resources you can access through the API, so you only import what you want.

Never used the Postman extension before? Check out [this link for a tutorial](http://wiki.acstechnologies.com/display/DevCom/POSTMAN+REST+Client+for+Chrome).


### PayPal resources we have collections for so far:
* [OAuth 2.0](https://github.com/UnexpectedEOF/paypal-rest-postman-collections/blob/master/collections/PayPal-REST-OAuth.json)
* [Payments](https://github.com/UnexpectedEOF/paypal-rest-postman-collections/blob/master/collections/PayPal-REST-Payments.json)
* [Refunds](https://github.com/UnexpectedEOF/paypal-rest-postman-collections/blob/master/collections/PayPal-REST-Refunds.json)
* [Sales](https://github.com/UnexpectedEOF/paypal-rest-postman-collections/blob/master/collections/PayPal-REST-Sales.json)
* [Stored/tokenized credit card (Vault)](https://github.com/UnexpectedEOF/paypal-rest-postman-collections/blob/master/collections/PayPal-REST-Vault.json)

By the way, this is still very much under construction. Don't expect any level of completeness for a while.
